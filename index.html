            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Computer programming is the process of performing a particular
                computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by
                designing/building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis,
                generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation
                of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding). The
                source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers,
                rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of
                programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which
                can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient
                programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the
                application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Laptop </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable
                personal computer (PC) with a screen and alphanumeric keyboard. Laptops typically have a clam shell form
                factor with the screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the
                lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a
                laptop mode. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.Its
                name comes from lap, as it was deemed practical to be placed on a person's lap when being used. Today,
                laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web
                browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.

                As of 2021, in American English, the terms laptop computer and notebook computer are used
                interchangeably; in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred. Although the terms
                notebook computers or notebooks originally referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller and
                lighter than mainstream laptops of the time), the terms have come to mean the same thing and notebook
                no longer refers to any specific size.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Game </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for
                entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are different from work, which
                is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or
                ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to
                be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or
                games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).

                Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can
                be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience
                of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand,
                players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the
                entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.
                A toy and a game are not the same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with
                present rules.
